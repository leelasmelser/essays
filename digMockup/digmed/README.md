## Origins of Nuclear Power
The idea of the atom has been around for centuries – the Greeks believing that our world was made up of tiny, invisible particles they named *atoms*, from the word *atomos*, meaning indivisible. In 1789, a German chemist discovered the element Uranium – named after the planet Uranus. Then, in 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered ionizing radiation – an energy released by atoms that appears as particles, like neutrons, or electromagnetic waves, like gamma or X-rays.[^1] Henri Becquerel discovered beta radiation in 1896 when he found that pitchblende, which contains both radium and uranium, caused a photographic plate to grow dark due to the beta radiation and the alpha particles that emitted from the pitchblende. In 1896, Marie and Pierre Curie deemed this emitting of particles *radioactivity* and went on to isolate polonium and radium from the pitchblende in 1898.[^2] Ernest Rutherford proved that radioactivity created a different element in 1902. In 1911, Frederick Soddy discovered that radioactive elements have different isotopes, or radionuclides, with the same chemistry. Rutherford then discovered nuclear rearrangement in 1919 when he fired alpha particles from radium into nitrogen, which created oxygen.[^3]

#### 1935
- October 22nd - Enrico Fermi discovers a method to create a greater variety of radionuclides using neutrons.
#### 1938
- Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann split uranium apart, creating several lighter elements – such as barium – which demonstrated atomic fission.
#### 1939
- Lise Meitner, Niels Bohr, and Otto Frisch used Hahn and Strassmann’s discovery to confirm Einstein’s theory of mass and energy from 1905 by calculating the masses of the fission products and finding that they did not equal the uranium’s mass, proving that it had been turned into energy during fission.
- Leo Szilard and Fermi propose a new method of slowing emitted neutrons to more effectively cause fission.
- Francis Perrin demonstrates fission in a uranium and water mixture and uses a neutron-absorbing material to control the reaction.  
- Werner Heisenberg calculated the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction and that it could generate energy.
- **September 1st - World War Two begins.**
- October 11th - The Einstein-Szilard letter is delivered to Roosevelt, advising him to look into nuclear fission as a weapon, as Germany may already be researching it.
- October 21st - The Advisory Committee on Uranium meets for the first time.

### Anti-Nuclear Protests
The Cold War sparked anti-nuclear weapons protests all over the world, eventually snowballing into an anti-nuclear power movement from the 50s[^61] into the 60s. Today, many anti-nuclear groups protest both nuclear weapons and power. According to these groups, nuclear power is dangerous and expensive[^62] – at a far greater risk of accidents or attack than any other type of power plant, as well as being environmentally harmful in its fuel mining and waste disposal. These groups argue, especially after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, that nuclear power can never be completely safe, so should not be used at all.[^63]

#### A Short List of Protests Against Nuclear Power [^64]
- 1961 - Women Strike for Peace marched through 60 cities in the United States
- 1975 - Protest of a proposed plant in Wyhl, West Germany
- 1981 - Germany's largest anti-nuclear power protest against the power plant to the west of Hamburg 
-1986 - Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament from Los Angeles to Washington D.C.
-1991 - Nevada Semipalatinsk protests led to the closure of the test site in north-east Kazakhstan
- 2007 - March in Kudzus, Indonesia protesting plans to build a nuclear power plant.
- 2010 - human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) between 2 nuclear plants in Germany
- 2011 - protest against nuclear power in Switzerland

Some anti-nuclear groups include: Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth International, World Disarmament Campaign, the Sierra Club, Nevada Desert Experiment, Nuclear Control Institute, and the Musicians United for Safe Energy. [^65] Some anti-nuclear advocates also happen to be fossil fuel companies[^66], such as: The American Petroleum Institute, Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association (PIOGA), Marcellus Shale Coalition, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Royal Dutch Shell, to name a few.[^67]
