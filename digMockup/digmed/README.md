## Origins of Nuclear Power[^1]

The idea of the atom has been around for centuries – the Greeks believing that our world was made up of tiny, invisible particles they named *atoms*, from the word *atomos*, meaning indivisible.[^2] In 1789, a German chemist discovered the element Uranium – named after the planet Uranus. Then, in 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered ionizing radiation – an energy released by atoms that appears as particles, like neutrons, or electromagnetic waves, like gamma or X-rays. Henri Becquerel discovered beta radiation in 1896 when he found that pitchblende, which contains both radium and uranium, caused a photographic plate to grow dark due to the beta radiation and the alpha particles that emitted from the pitchblende. In 1896, Marie and Pierre Curie deemed this emitting of particles *radioactivity* and went on to isolate polonium and radium from the pitchblende in 1898. Ernest Rutherford proved that radioactivity created a different element in 1902. In 1911, Frederick Soddy discovered that radioactive elements have different isotopes, or radionuclides, with the same chemistry. Rutherford then discovered nuclear rearrangement in 1919 when he fired alpha particles from radium into nitrogen, which created oxygen.[^3]

The Chicago Pile-1, or CP-1, was a 20 foot tall stack of graphite and uranium blocks arranged in 56 layers with cadmium control rods.[^10] The pile was completed December 1st. On December 2nd, 49 scientists gathered, and Fermi “directed the operators to slowly move the control rods, and their instruments clicked to record the neutron count. At 3:53 p.m., they recorded that a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved for the first time ever. It had taken 28 minutes.”[^11]
